#SudokuSolver

A program that solves sudoku using python

Mostly for practicing the use of GitHub, but also to practice python

#To do list:

-> (Done) A main class

-> A sudoku class that read the input, forming a sudoku square, and can solve it, then print it

-> Show each step of the solving

-> Generate random sudoku squares

-> Graphic interface that let me input numbers in the empty spots and that checks the final result if it's valid

-> (Maybe) When entering a number, the game tells me if it's valid or not
